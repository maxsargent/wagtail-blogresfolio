# wagtail-blogresfolio
A website made using Pythons Django framework and wagtail CMS.

A blog, resume and portfolio site - blogresfolio.

Will be following https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification for commit message formatting.

Will try to limit the number of types to:

- feat - new additions to the source
- fix - changes to existing source
- docs - updating the readme or any other docs
- misc - miscellaneous type for everything else

As for scopes we will add them as we go, I think breaking out the Django apps into feats will work well:

- blog - any work on the blog
- res - any work on the resume
- folio - any work on the portfolio
- dependencies - adding to requirements.txt 
- config - modifying configuration files suck as dockerfiles or gitignores etc
